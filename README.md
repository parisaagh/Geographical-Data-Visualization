Geographical Data Visualization in Excel

This project demonstrates how to visualize geographical data using Excel. The focus is on creating interactive maps for sales data by state and city. The project includes a dataset with city, state, and sales data, which is used to generate geographical maps and analyze sales distribution across different regions.

 Purpose

The goal of this project is to showcase how to use Excel's built-in mapping tools to visualize and analyze geographical data, helping to identify trends and patterns in sales performance based on location.

Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel: Used for creating the dataset, processing the data, and generating geographical maps.
- Geographical Data: The dataset includes states, cities, and corresponding sales figures that are used to create the maps.

How the Project Works

1. Data Organization: The project uses a dataset where each row contains a city, a state, and the sales data for that location. Excel’s map chart feature is used to visualize the geographical distribution of the sales data.
2. Map Chart: Excel's map chart automatically recognizes the state and city columns and plots the data on a map of the USA, displaying the sales data in different regions using color gradients.
3. Sales Analysis: By visualizing the sales data geographically, you can quickly identify which regions perform better or worse, helping in decision-making and strategic planning.
